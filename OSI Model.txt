---OSI Open systems Interconnects
	1- Physical--BITS-Hubs,RJ45--1000-baseX-The physical layer is responsible for the physical communication between end
		stations. It is concerned with the actual encoding and transmission of data in electromechanical
		terms of voltage and wavelength .RJ45 and 1000-base x
	2- Data link layer--Frame-NICS,Switch ,Bridges--WAN 802.11 this.MAC adresses and Vlans.Broadcast and collision domains.Decides maintains and establishes how the transfer is accomplished over the physical media.
	Firewalls is Layer 3 and 4.
	3- Network--Packet--Dedicated to routing and switching information to different networks. LANs or internetworks
	4- Transport- Segment-TCP/UDP
	5- Session- Data-log on /log off
	6- Presentation-Data-encryption /compression
	7- Aplication-Data-FTP,POP,HTTP
