FOUR IMPORTANT THINGS

-ACCESS- 
physical and electronic controls that prevent unauthorized users from viewing sensitive information. This includes keeping servers and data centers in secure locations, but also making sure effective password controls, lockout screens and other measures are in place. Implementing the principle of least privilege (POLP) is generally considered one of the best methods of organization-wide access control.
-Security
IT security is, of course, a broad topic. In this case, it means making sure appropriate controls are in place to prevent breaches and having tools to remediate incidents as they occur. Taking steps to manage risk is a good policy regardless of SOX compliance status. Investing smartly in services or appliances that will monitor and protect your financial database is the best way to avoid compliance and security issues altogether.
-Change management
Change management involves your IT departmentâ€™s processes for adding new users or workstations, updating and installing new software, and making any changes to Active Directory databases or other information architecture components. Having a record of what was changed, in addition to when it was changed and who changed it, simplifies a SOX IT audit and makes it easier to correct problems when they arise
-BackupProcedures 
Backup systems should be in place to protect your sensitive data. Data centers containing backed-up data including those stored off site or by a third party are subject to the same SOX compliance requirements as those hosted on-premises.
